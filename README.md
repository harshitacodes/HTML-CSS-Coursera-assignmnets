# HTML-CSS-Cousrsera-Assignments
## In this repo I've added coursera assignments in which I've made it responsive for mobile, tablets and laptop.
### I've made the structure of the web-page by using ``html``.
#### And for giving styles I've used ``CSS``.
##### for making my web page responsive I've used ``@MEDIA QUERY``
